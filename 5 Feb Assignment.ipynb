    "#The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "#Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features to the user. This allows you to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into smaller and more manageable parts.\n",
    "#Encapsulation: Wrapping the data and functions that operate on that data within a single unit or object. This helps to reduce the coupling between objects and makes the system more modular and flexible.\n",
    "#Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes. The new classes inherit all the attributes and behaviors of the existing classes, which makes it easier to reuse existing code and to create new classes that are customized for specific needs.\n",
    "#Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. This allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different types, making your code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n"
